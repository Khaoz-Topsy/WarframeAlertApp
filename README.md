# WarframeAlertApp
A simple Electron app running some Angular code to display a pretty interface showing the current Warframe Alerts

### Install
in the "WarframeAlertApp\Angular-src\shared\service\baseService.js" file
1. Change URL and Key
2. URL can be set to 'http://tennodex.com' (for now)
3. Key is the API Key that you can get from me, feel free to ask for one (I will have a system up eventually)
